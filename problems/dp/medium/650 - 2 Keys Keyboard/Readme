### How is it DP?

### Sub-problem

If I know solution of n - 1 do I know solution of n?

If I know solution of n do I know solution of n + 1?

Suppose I've min count for 6

for 7 the min count would be minCount(6) + ?

**Because this is missing the other variable, which is what's on the clipboard we need to apply double dimensional DP.**

one dimension is number of desired A.
second dimension is what's on the clipboard.

What's on the clipboard in worst case can be equal to n.

Hence, the DP matrix will be n x n.

|   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 2 | 4 | 6 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |   |   |
| 2 | 0 |   |   |   |
| 3 | 0 |   |   |   |
